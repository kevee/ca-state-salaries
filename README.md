California State Salaries
=========================

This is a collection of salaries and wages of all California state employees in easily-parseable JSON format. This information was obtained from oddly-formatted excel files provided by the state, which have been cleaned up and provided here for your enjoyment.

Why?
====

The original author is a state employee himself, and wanted to make a widget for Google Apps calendars that showed just how much a meeting was costing the state in salaries just for fun. It also helped to turn down meetings because they would cost too much, or on the other hand, to consider any meeting costing less than $1000 as being not worth attending.
